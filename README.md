# mongodb_like_implementation
Execute mongodb syntax search query on a local data (list of dicts)

The code takes a query (based on MongoDB syntax) and executes it on an "inventory" in the form of a list of dictionaries. Inventory can be altered to any file in the form of a list of dictionaries. the code doesn't use MongoDB, just designed to "read" queries based on that syntax.
